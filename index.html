<h1>THE LONELIEST</h1>
<p>Song by Måneskin</p>
<p>You'll be the saddest part of me<br>
A part of me that will never be mine<br>
It's obvious<br>
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest<br>
You're still the oxygen I breathe<br>
I see your face when I close my eyes</p><br>
<p>It's torturous<br>
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest<br>
There's a few lines that I have wrote<br>
In case of death, that's what I want, that's what I want<br>
So don't be sad when I'll be gone</p><br>
<p>There's just one thing I hope you know, I loved you so<br>
'Cause I don't even care about the time I've got left here<br>
The only thing I know now is that I wanna spend it<br>
With you, with you nobody else here<br>
Tonight is gonna be the loneliest<br>
You'll be the saddest part of me<br>
A part of me that will never be mine</p>
